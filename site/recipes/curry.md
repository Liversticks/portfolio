## Procedure
With adequate parallelism, this can be done in approximately 1h 30 mins. Otherwise, it can take up to 2h 30m - 3h.

### Prepare stew ingredients
1. Wash brisket and pat dry. Cut the brisket into ~1 inch wide blocks. In a bowl, mix together the cut brisket, salt, black pepper, and flour until the meat is fully covered.
2. Cut the bacon into smaller strips.
3. Peel and cut onion into eighths (half, then half, then half again).
4. Wash, peel, and cut the potatoes into blocks (they will shrink in the stew).
5. Wash, peel, and cut the carrots into chunks.
6. Peel the taro root and cut it into 1/2" x 3/2" strips (finely cut taro will disappear into the stew).
7. Wash and cut the tomatoes. Peel and cut the garlic and ginger into small pieces. Blend the tomatoes/ketchup, garlic, and ginger until smooth.

### Prepare curry powder
1. Toast the whole spices, then crush them (mortar and pestle or coffee grinder).
2. Mix the powdered spices in a bowl; add in the crushed spices.

### Searing meat
1. Sear the bacon with 1 Tbsp of oil.
2. Sear the brisket in batches to avoid overcrowding. Add 1 Tbsp of oil for each batch.

### Main stew sequence (can be done in the same pot)
1. Using the oil from browning the meat, sautee the onion with some salt and pepper. (Cooking the onions for longer makes them softer).
2. Add the blended tomato/garlic/ginger sauce and 1-2 Tbsp of curry powder.
3. Add the meat and alcohol. Evaporating all the alcohol is optional.
4. Add all the vegetables except the mushrooms. Add stock and enough water to cover the stew contents (the stew should not be too thick or it will burn).
5. Turn the heat to max. When the stew is boiling, strain off the scum, add a bay leaf, then simmer until the meat reaches the desired tender (45 min - 1 h).
6. Add the roux, stirring to make sure it is fully dissolved.
7. Add the milk and Worcestershire sauce.
8. Before serving, remove any excess spices if so desired.

### Roux sequence
1. In a small pot on low heat, cook the soilds and oil together for 15-30 mins.
2. Mix in the remaining curry powder.

### Mushrooms
Wait until the stew is almost ready (step 6 of the main sequence).
1. Wash and cut the mushrooms into thin slices.
2. Sautee the mushrooms with 1 Tbsp of olive oil, salt, and pepper.

### Notes
- To make the stew thicker, add more roux (1:1 oil:flour) or 1:1 cornstarch:cold water.
- I've tried this recipe with red wine (2 cups), white wine (2 cups), beer (2 cans), and rum (1 cup).
- For a creamier stew, add coconut milk (make sure to stir extra to avoid burning).
- At the end, optionally add soy sauce or pepper oil.
- Feel free to mix and match vegetables based on what is available. I've made this recipe with kabocha and celery; make sure that the vegetables are cut to an edible size and added based on their cooking time.
